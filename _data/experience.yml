    <p>This was David's first job as an engineer. He was placed onto a core services and
    tooling team. This meant that development could happen much more quickly, but also
    that when standards were changed his team had to be among the first to adapt.</p>

    that training to the test. As a result, he is the engineer that people come to when searching for
    a resource on the products and services of the team.</p>
