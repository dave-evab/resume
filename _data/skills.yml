    <p>For many, engineering is a job. For David, it's a hobby.</p>
    <p>From a young age he has been drawn to technology. At 10 he was playing MMORPGs
    on a dial-up connection. At 13 he attempted his first foray into programming with
    C++. Around that time, he took an interest in game development and made a few games
    for friends in ActionScript 3. In highschool he applied that knowledge and went
    to state and national competitions. He enjoyed the knowledge that college provided
    him so much that he graduated with the highest honors in three and a half years.</p>
    <p>Now, David is living the dream and getting paid to do what he loves.</p>
